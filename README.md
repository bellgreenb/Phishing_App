 # Phishing Application
 For educationl purposes ONLY. Demonstrates how phishing applications can be made by threat actors. Breaches
 confidentiality, which then affects the integrity and availability of a user's account and other PII.

  Here, the victim would be tricked into giving in their username and password before clicking login.
  Little do they know, however, that the application doesn't actually log the user in.

  Actually, when the login button is clicked, the victim's username and password is sent to my email inbox.
  If I wanted to, I could log in as them and steal even more information. Always be careful when prompted
  to log in when clicking on attachments to seemingly legitimate organizations, such as banks or service 
  providers.
